Optimizing Compilers (opticomp) Changes
===

To Top-level compiler:
added the -opticomp-enable flag to ocamlc so flambda passes do array bounds analysis

## Building the Compiler

#### Automatic:
  * run `./opticomp.sh`

#### Manual:
  * To build the compiler, navigate to the top-level directory and execute the following commands:

    mkdir -p install
    ./configure -prefix `pwd`/install -flambda
    make opt.opt
    make install

:+1:

If you stop `make world.opt` build, then it's possible you will have to `make clean` and/or reconfigure if you get an error such as "[files] make inconsistent assumptions over interface ...".

To run, use `./install/bin/ocamlopt -opticomp-enable`
